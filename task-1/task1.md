### Steps

1. **Set up the project**:
   - Create a folder on your computer called `profile-page`.
   - Inside the folder, create two files: `index.html` and `style.css`.

2. **Create the basic HTML structure**:
   - Open `index.html` and start by writing the basic HTML structure:

3. **Add a profile picture**:
   - Inside the `body` tag, add an image element for your profile picture. For now, you can use a placeholder image URL (or download an image of yourself and place it in your folder).

4. **Add your name and a short description**:
   - Below the image, add your name and a short paragraph about yourself.
   

5. **Add a contact section**:
   - Below your description, create a contact section with your email and social media links.
    

6. **Style the profile page using CSS**:
   - Now open `style.css` and start adding basic styling:

### Steps to Style the `<body>` Content:

1. **Center-align the text**:
   - Add styles to the `body` to center-align the content and apply a basic font.
  

2. **Style the profile picture (`<img>`)**:
   - Make the profile picture circular using border-radius and add some margin at the top
  

3. **Style your name (`<h1>`)**:
   - Customize the font size and spacing of your name.
  
4. **Style the description (`<p>`)**:
   - Make the paragraph (your short description) a bit more readable by adjusting font size and color.
   

5. **Style the contact section heading (`<h2>`)**:
   - Increase the font size of the "Contact Me" section.
  

6. **Style the contact list (`<ul>` and `<li>`)**:
   - Remove bullet points from the list and add some spacing between list items.
  

7. **Style the contact links (`<a>`)**:
   - Change the color of your links to blue and add an underline on hover.
